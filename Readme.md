# SLP Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication in ReactJS.

We will be able to create a new user by email address, sign in, sign out, and check to see if a user is signed in or not.

We will use react-router-dom version 6 to navigate pages after signing in. We will also use protected routes. This means we will be required to be signed-in as a user to view the specified page otherwise the we will be routed to the sign in page.

Context will be used so we can access the user details in any of our React components wrapped in our Provider.

All the user interface styling is done with Tailwind CSS.
